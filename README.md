# MySchedUL 

## General
MySchedUL is a MySQL scheduling app designed to solve the problem of scheduling people when they are unavailable. As the admin moves the slider around to modify the times, the availability information is queried to add or remove employees from the dropdown list, only displaying employees that are available for that time frame.
